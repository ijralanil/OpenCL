This example performs multipication of an array elements with a constant number and stores result in another array.
It has 4 kernels files, having
          - A simple kernel with loops
          - A 1 dimensional kernel, accessing data with global Ids.
          - A 2 dimensional kernel, accessing data with global Ids.
          - A 2 dimensional kernel, accessing data with local and group Ids.
