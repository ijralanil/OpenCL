This program shows a way to setup the host to launch a kernel.
The kernel in this example, performs multiplication operation on an array and stores result in another array.
It has 4 kernels files, having
          - A simple kernel with loops
          - A 1 dimensional kernel, accessing data with global Ids.
          - A 2 dimensional kernel, accessing data with global Ids.
          - A 2 dimensional kernel, accessing data with local and group Ids.
